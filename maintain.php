						<div class="tin_text"> 
						
						<p>How does oil protect my engine?<br> In many ways:

By cleaning the engine – Shell Helix oils are designed to clear away dirt, debris and deposits from engine components and to prevent blockages in important oil ways. The oil helps to lock up the dirt and render it harmless until it is removed at the next oil change.

By reducing friction and minimising wear – Shell Helix oils form a protective film over your engine components and have special additives that act between the moving surfaces to prevent contact and reduce drag. This helps your engine to operate as quietly and effectively as the designers intended.

By removing heat – Shell Helix oils carry heat away from hot areas, such as around the piston rings where the temperature can reach up to 320°C, and redistribute it around the engine.<br><br>How should I dispose of used oil?<br> Used oil can pollute the environment and should never be poured down the drain. In many markets it is also illegal to do this. Instead, take your waste to an official oil-disposal or recycling bank (these are often located at local refuse collection points). Alternatively, ask your local authority recycling officer for guidance.<br><br>What is the difference between a gasoline engine and a diesel engine?<br>In a diesel engine, there is no spark plug. Instead, diesel fuel is injected into the cylinder, and the heat and pressure of the compression stroke cause the fuel to ignite. Diesel fuel has a higher energy density than gasoline, so a diesel engine gets better mileage.<br><br>Are there any other cycles besides the Otto cycle used in car engines?<br>he two-stroke engine cycle is different, as is the diesel cycle described above. The engine in the Mazda Millenia uses a modification of the Otto cycle called the Miller cycle. Gas turbine engines use the Brayton cycle. Wankel rotary engines use the Otto cycle, but they do it in a very different way than four-stroke piston engines.</p>
